  <div class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a groundbreaking exploration into the dynamic realm of data virtualization, where 3D visualization meets the power of Unity software. Our project embarks on a transformation in the way we interact with and comprehend data. In a world inundated with information, conventional 2D data representation often falls short in capturing the complexity and richness of datasets. Acknowledging this limitation, our project takes a bold step into the third dimension, leveraging the capabilities of Unity to bring data to life in a vibrant 3D environment. Our project's 3D data visualization isn't just visually captivatingâ€”it's also intellectually enlightening. Patterns that might have gone unnoticed in traditional representations now emerge from the depths, guiding data-driven decisions and discoveries. The immersive environment enhances analytical capabilities, turning raw information into actionable insights.</p>

    <h2>What is Data Visualization?</h2>
   <p>Data visualization is a graphical representation of quantitative information and data by using visual elements like graphs, charts, and maps. Data visualization converts large and small data sets into visuals, which are easy to understand and process for humans.Data visualization tools provide accessible ways to understand outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.
    In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are required to analyze vast amounts of information. Data visualizations are common in everyday life, appearing in the form of graphs and charts. The combination of multiple visualizations and bits of information is still referred to as Infographics.Data visualizations are used to discover unknown facts and trends. Line charts display change over time, bar and column charts observe relationships and make comparisons, pie charts show parts-of-a-whole, and maps share geographical data visually.
    Today's data visualization tools go beyond the charts and graphs used in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, displaying data in more sophisticated ways such as dials and gauges, geographic maps, heat maps, pie charts, and fever charts. Data visualization is important because it processes information in human brains. Using graphs and charts to visualize complex data sets is more comfortable compared to studying spreadsheets and reports.Data visualization is an easy and quick way to convey concepts universally. You can experiment with different outlines by making slight adjustments. Data visualization has more specialties, such as identifying areas that need improvement or modifications, clarifying factors that influence customer behavior, helping understand where to place products, and predicting sales volumes.

        <h2>Use of Unity</h2>
        <p>Unity made this project possible. The spheres are added as a material which were later colored in different colors as per the requirement. Different assets were added to the package and a prefab was created. We need to turn the sphere into a prefab, so we can create clones of it on demand for our scatterplot. First, select the sphere and change its scale to be .25 in x, y, z, since the default size is too large for our purposes. This can be done by either changing the values in the inspector (under Transform), or by selecting the scale tool button in the top left corner of the main Unity window and manipulating it in the scene window.</p>

        <h2>Data importing into Unity</h2>
        <p>Unity can read a wide variety of data types. As you can imagine, it takes a lot of different kinds of data to build a fully-functioning video game, such as images, 3d models, and sounds. Naturally, Unity can recognize CSV files. Getting Unity to parse CSVs, however, is unfortunately not as easy. There are two main steps: 1) creating a script to actually read and parse the data, 2) getting your data and putting it into a folder called Resources.</p>
